    (1, "Greetings, dear listeners, gather 'round as I, Songweaver, spin a tale of mystery and peril. In this quaint hamlet, where shadows cling to the walls and fear echoes in hushed whispers, you, my fellow adventurer, stand at the crossroads of a daunting quest. A series of vicious murders has cast a sinister pall over the village, and now the stage is set for your investigation.
    
    As the melody of my story unfolds, you step into the role of the investigator, a seeker of truth in the face of encroaching darkness. The hamlet's secrets are woven into the very fabric of its existence, waiting for you to unravel the threads that bind this malevolent tale. The villagers, each a note in this haunting composition, possess fragments of the puzzle, concealed behind the curtain of their fears.
    
    In this harmonious dance between danger and cunning, heed my words and be wise. Collect the scattered notes of wisdom strewn across the village, for they may compose the very song that guides you through the crescendo of confrontation. Ready yourself, dear adventurer, for the climax awaits, where your mettle shall be tested against an unseen adversary.
    
    So, let the melody of investigation guide your steps, and may the rhythm of discovery fortify your resolve. In this hamlet's lament, together we shall conduct the symphony of justice and unveil the melody of survival.", 'https://trello.com/1/cards/65aad863a07daa5f53e29be1/attachments/65aae69e2724256329682866/previews/65aae69f2724256329682ac2/download/Female_Halfling_Bard.png', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL),
